# Welcome to My Personal Website

This website was created to showcase my skills, experiences, and projects to potential employers and collaborators. It is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and deployed on Azure, a cloud computing platform by Microsoft.

## Features

A section for my education and work experience
A portfolio of my projects, with descriptions and links to live demos
A contact form for visitors to get in touch with me

## Deployment

The website is hosted on Azure and is constantly monitored to ensure maximum uptime and performance.

## Future Plans

This website is a work in progress, and I plan to continually add new features and improve its design. Some of the things I have in mind include:

Adding more projects to my portfolio
Improving the blog section by adding categories, tags, and a search feature
Implementing authentication and allowing visitors to save their favorite projects
Integrating with external APIs to fetch data and create dynamic pages

## Conclusion

The Website is live [here](www.maodaniel.com)
